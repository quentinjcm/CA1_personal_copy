ESENTIAL:
  implement phong shading // still need to do reflections
  implement parser // add obj support

EXTRA:
  ui
  viewport
  secondary triangle intersection that stops as soon as it hits a barrier

  create a geometry sub class so that the geo prim can contain a pointer to any type of geometry

  get rid of my bbox and have one which inherits from his instead and adds the intersection routine
  or
  have give each mesh an array of bboxes, which are checked for intersections, if one is found, then the contained triangle is also checked

BUGS:
  swap dummp for nullptr not working in shadow ray
